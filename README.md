# Some old works I did at school. Profs already deprecated these WSs and Assignments. It is safe to switch to public mode.
## All the good habits are learned from these works. 
## Those OOP pillars are engraved in brain now. 
## Templates, virtual function and dynamic dispatch, interface, abstract class, DMA. All the good memories...
